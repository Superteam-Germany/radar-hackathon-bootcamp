# Building on Solana without Rust
While Solana development primarily involves writing Rust programs, a powerful approach is to utilize existing programs. Many developers overlook the benefits of this strategy. By leveraging pre-built programs, you can save time, reduce complexity, and potentially avoid common pitfalls. These programs often offer well-tested functionalities and are maintained by experienced developers, ensuring reliability and security.

Example: Instead of creating your own token program from scratch, you could use a popular, established token program like SPL Token. This saves you from the intricacies of implementing token mechanics and allows you to focus on building your specific application.
